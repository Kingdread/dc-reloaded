Quoi?
-----

dc-reloaded is a rewrite of the [microprocessor simulation][original] (german
site) by [Horst Gierhardt][gierhardt], written in Python and open source. It
(should) support everything the original DC.EXE supports.

DC is a little processor simulation with a small assembler instruction set,
designed as a teaching/learning tool to show the internal processes of a CPU.
You can use DC to show how simple loops are implemented with conditional jumps,
but also to demonstrate more complex procedures like subprograms with
parameters and return values or recursion.

Puorquoi?
--------

*Why not?*

Usage
-----

The documentation is not yet finished, you can find a german reference manual
on the [original program's website][original]. You can also find some example
programs on the site.

In the future I will write/translate a manual tailored to this DC
implementation.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3
* PyQt 5

Installation
------------

Refer to the documentation for detailed installation instructions.

tl;dr:

    sudo python3 setup.py install

**This will install dc-reloaded system-wide**. The documentation contains a
tutorial to install it in a python virtual environment. If the command
finishes, you can run

    dc-reloaded

to start DC reloaded. If you get an error Ã  la

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ImportError: No module named 'PyQt5'

then you need to install [PyQt5][pyqt].

Modifying
---------

Feel free to wreak havoc in the source and change whatever you want.

If you would like to see your changes pulled into the repository, you should
adhere to some basic style guidelines as [PEP 8][pep8]. The `Makefile` contains
a `lint` target to run `pylint` and `flake8`. You should try to not introduce
any lint failures.

If you modify anything in `resource-files/`, such as the background image or
the UI layout, you need to regenerate the relevant Python files. The `Makefile`
has targets `window`, `resources` and `all` as a shorthand for both. Thus, if
you modify resources, always run

    make all

Have fun!
